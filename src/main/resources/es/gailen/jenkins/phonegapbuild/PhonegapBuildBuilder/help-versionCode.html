  MUST BE A NUMBER. Version used for internal build tagging in both Apple and Google stores. Maps to 'versionCode' and 'CFBundleVersion' in config.xml.

  If not setted, the information from <strong>config.xml</strong> will be used. If setted, the <strong>config.xml</strong> will be <strong>modified in Jenkins' working directory</strong>.

  <strong>Beware:</strong> If you ask Phonegap Build plugin to override this field in <strong>www/config.xml</strong>, you better make sure your git or svn working copy in Jenkins gets resetted with every build.
